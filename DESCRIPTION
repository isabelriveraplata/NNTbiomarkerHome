Description: The role of NNTbiomarker is to help a clinical trial team  discuss
    the clinical goals  of a well-defined biomarker with a diagnostic,
    staging, prognostic, or predictive purpose.  From this discussion will
    come a statistical plan for a (non-randomized) validation trial.
    Both prospective and retrospective trials are supported. In a specific
    focused discussion, investigators should determine the range of
    "discomfort" for the NNT, number needed to treat.  The meaning of
    the discomfort range, [NNTlower, NNTupper], is that  within this range
    most physicians would feel discomfort either in treating or withholding
    treatment. A pair of NNT values bracketing that range, NNTpos and NNTneg,
    become the targets of the study's design.  If the trial can demonstrate
    that a positive biomarker test yields an NNT less than NNTlower,
    and that a negative biomarker test yields an NNT less than NNTlower,
    then the biomarker may be useful for patients.
