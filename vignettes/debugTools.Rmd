The shiny apps included in this package include at the top a toggle to show (or hide) a debugTools panel. This panel allows you to investigate what's going on in your package. You can toggle on or off the shiny trace option, evaluate a Javascript expression, or evaluate an R expression.  The use of capture.output allows more complex objects unfriendly to cat(), in particular lists, to be viewed.
